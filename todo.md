tests

- finish refactoring control center, and add tests
- Make sure the control center correctly controls the flow over a long long period of time. Axons added recently? if so then particiapnts added recently; Any synthetic queries left? All this stuff should give a lot of good insight
- Fix the signing service to be more secure
- See if dendrites work or need completely rewriting
- Try to run everything synthetic only, and be confident its working (alerts, grafana board, all that jazz)
- Add organic support
- Easy validator setup and running


What to change when making a new inference subnet?
- Synthetic generation Funcs
- Task config in core
- Mining code - but this needs binning anyway
- weight setting calculations
