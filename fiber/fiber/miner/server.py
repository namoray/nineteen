TODO:
- ADD A 'POST DETAILS TO CHAIN' METHOD FOR MINERS TO POST THEIR AXON DETAILS TO THE CHAIN
- INTEGRATE THIS NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS INTO THE SUBNET CODE, BYE BYE SYNAPSES AND DENDRITES
- BIN SIGNING SERVICE, BIN CHAIN NODE, PUT INTRO CONTROL NODE
- CONTROL NODE SHOULD ALSO CHANGE TEH WAY IT SCHEDULES TO SCHEDULE BY TASK NOT BY PARTICIPANT, ABSTRACTS A LOT BETTER THAT WAY
- ALSO JUST THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE PARTICIPANTS, CHECKING THEM OVER ONE HOUR, ETC. IS THERE NOT A MORE CONTINUOUS SATISFYING WAY OF DOING IT?S
- Let client nodes be queried by anyone who signs a message and verifies them
- Write a small package based on fiber for this
- DDOS protection for valis using redis & a banhammer
- Integrate with the vali UI's
- THEN TEST motha
