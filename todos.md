# Features to be included in the Vision 5.0 release:

## Fiber stuff:
- T&C's  [ 10 min]
- Redis and postgres no ports for prod compose I think

### Might need bugfix
- Post to sn19.ai + with the created_at time pointing to the time of the query, not time of insertion


## Shortly after Vision 5.0 release
- Specialist miners. Miners will be in 3 categories for launch: Small LLM's, Medium LLM's, Image generation - and can only run one type of miner on a uid
- Speed scoring to be based off medians - and potentially using the distribution of miners instead of a fixed distribution [Do this after to minimise chanegs to 5.0 first]
- Add in DUIS
- DAPI
- Change text synthetics to pull from a larger text orientated dataset [1hr - fast follow]
- Streaming smoothness [45 min, can be a fast follow after launch]
