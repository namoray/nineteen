# Features to be included in the Vision 5.0 release:


## Shortly after Vision 5.0 release
- Specialist miners. Miners will be in 3 categories for launch: Small LLM's, Medium LLM's, Image generation - and can only run one type of miner on a uid
- Speed scoring to be based off medians - and potentially using the distribution of miners instead of a fixed distribution [Do this after to minimise chanegs to 5.0 first]
- Add in DUIS
- DAPI
- Change text synthetics to pull from a larger text orientated dataset [1hr - fast follow]
- Streaming smoothness [45 min, can be a fast follow after launch]
