# Overview

Validating on ninteen is special.

Not only do you validate miners are behaving, set some weights and get some tao - you also get to sell your access to these miners ðŸ¤©


A Validator consists of two parts:

- Proxy API server
- Orchestrator server

The proxy server is the server which has your hotkey,  spins up the NODE, allows you to sell your bandwidth, etc. 

The Orchestrator performs the checking tasks, to make sure the miners are behaving ðŸ«¡


# Proxy server setup

Get a CPU VM (Digital Ocean Droplet, OVH, Vultr, etc)  - make sure you have an open port if you want to run a organic API server.

**Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/namoray/nineteen.git
cd nineteen
```

## Install system dependencies

If you are in a container, run these:

**With autoupdates (recommended, especially now we have child hotkeys)**

```bash
sudo -E ./bootstrap.sh
source $HOME/.bashrc
```
Your server will now automatically be running - but it wont work until the config has been created

**Without autoupdates :-(**

If you are concerned about running autoupdates because of security, please message me and I'm sure we can work something out!
```bash
WITH_AUTOUPDATES=0 sudo -E ./bootstrap.sh 
```


## Get hot and coldkeys onto your machine

Securely move them onto your machine as usual. Either with the btcli or with a secure method of your choosing.


## Create the necessary config


```bash
python core/create_config.py
```
(^ Add --dev flag if you are a developer on nineteen)

If you're running the autoupdater, then you should be running!

Check your autoupdater to see the docker containers building (might take a few minutes on first build)
```bash
pm2 logs validator_autoupdater
```

## Start the services if you don't have autoupdates

```bash
docker compose --env-file .vali.env -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

See [helpful commands](./helpful-commands.md) for more information on the docker commands

## If you ever need to set weights manually to stop dereg etc

Run 
```bash
task set_weights
```

If you don't have any values in the db it will use the metagraph. It warns you and gives you time to stop this, if that is not something you want to do

## Trouble shooting

**Problem**:

Error: pq: password authentication failed for user "user"

**Solution**:

```bash
sudo rm -rf postgres_data
docker compose --env-file .vali.env -f docker-compose.yml  up -d --build
```
# Orchestrator setup

## Starting the Orchestrator server

Currently, a bare metal GPU is necessary for validating the GPU models. Please see here for the full instructions!(https://github.com/namoray/vision-workers/tree/main/validator_orchestrator#readme)

Once this is done, make a note of the IP address of that machine, and the port the orchestrator is running on (the default is 6920, if you didn't change anything)


# Managing organic access

**Note this is optional - only if you want to sell your bandwidth. If you don't, you are done!**
